Founders often mix up **409A valuation** and **ESOP valuation**, assuming they are the same. They’re related, but very different and mixing them up can create compliance issues.

### **What is a 409A Valuation?**

A 409A determines the **fair market value of common shares** in a U.S. startup. This FMV becomes the ESOP “strike price.” It is regulated under U.S. tax law and must be done by an independent third-party valuer.

### **What is an ESOP Valuation?**

Outside the U.S. (especially in **India**), ESOP valuation refers to determining the **fair value of options** for accounting and reporting (Ind-AS 102). Here, companies use models like Black-Scholes for expense recognition not for strike price.

### **Key Differences**

| Feature | 409A Valuation (USA) | ESOP Valuation (India) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Set strike price | Accounting expense |
| Regulation | IRS (IRC 409A) | MCA + Ind-AS |
| Method | OPM / Backsolve | Black-Scholes |
| Validity | 12 months | No fixed period |
| Required for | ESOP grants | Financial reporting |

### **Why This Matters**

If you’re an Indian founder with a Delaware entity:

* 409A determines the **price at which employees receive shares**
    
* ESOP valuation determines the **cost that hits your P&L**
    

Both are needed but serve different objectives.

Understanding the distinction helps you stay compliant in both jurisdictions.
