409A valuations protect startups, but founders often make mistakes that lead to compliance trouble. Here are the most common ones:

### **1️⃣ Not getting a 409A before granting ESOPs**

Granting stock options without a valid valuation exposes employees to IRS penalties—not worth the risk.

### **2️⃣ Using internal or CA-made valuations**

409A must be done by an **independent third-party**. Internal valuations don’t qualify for safe-harbor.

### **3️⃣ Not updating after fundraising**

If you raise capital and continue using the old valuation, it’s invalid.

### **4️⃣ Assuming preferred share price = common share price**

Preferred shares have rights; common shares don’t.  
Common stock FMV is always lower.

### **5️⃣ Not keeping financials updated**

Accurate data = accurate valuation.

### **6️⃣ Using cheap, low-quality valuation firms**

If the report isn’t audit-ready, your company is at risk during due diligence or IRS review.

Avoid these mistakes and your fundraising, audits, and ESOP processes will be smoother and safer.
