A 409A valuation is more than a formality—it’s the legal backbone behind issuing ESOPs in a U.S. startup. Every Delaware C-Corp or U.S. entity issuing stock options must maintain an **up-to-date 409A valuation** to stay compliant. But founders often get confused about *timing*. So here’s a clear checklist.

### **1️⃣ Before You Issue ESOPs**

You **must** have a valid 409A before granting options. If you issue options without one, the IRS can treat the grant as discounted compensation and penalize employees heavily. No founder wants that.

### **2️⃣ After Every Fundraising Round**

Whenever you raise capital—whether it’s a SAFE, Seed, or Series A—your company’s valuation changes. This counts as a **material event**, and you must refresh your 409A.

### **3️⃣ Every 12 Months (Standard Expiry)**

Even if nothing major happens, a 409A valuation expires after **12 months**. Renewing it annually gives you safe-harbor protection.

### **4️⃣ When a Material Event Occurs**

A material event is something that meaningfully changes your company’s value:

* A major revenue jump
    
* A down-round
    
* Acquiring another company
    
* A big pivot or model change
    
* Large customer contracts
    

Any of these require a 409A refresh.

### **Why Timely 409A Matters**

A current 409A:

* Protects employees from IRS penalties
    
* Allows you to grant options legally
    
* Increases trust during due diligence
    
* Prevents auditors from questioning FMV
    

**In short,** get a 409A before ESOP grants, update it after fundraising, and renew it every year. Simple rule, big protection.
